This project introduces classes, and reviews using multiple .cpp and .h files in one project. The program defines a Date class and Zodiac Reader class: 
* The Date class has month and day member variables
* The Zodiac Reader reads the Date and evaluates the Zodiac sign that corresponds to that date. It also reports whether the passed date is on the cusp of two signs (within 4 days of the following sign).
