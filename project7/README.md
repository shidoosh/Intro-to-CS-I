# More C++ Classes 
This project introduces implementing a more complex program with several files and classes. The objective was to simulate the dice game Bunco. The program defines the Board, BoardRow, Die, Player, and Bunco classes. It reviews how classes can interact with each other to create a larger program, and produce more readable code.
