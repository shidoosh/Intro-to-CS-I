# C++ Array Practice 
This project reviews C++ arrays. The objective was to implement basic functions that evaluate and/or modify a passed array. These include: 
* locateMinimum: finding the minimum value in the array relative to its data type 
* findLastOccurence: finding the last occurrence of a passed value in the array 
* flipAround: reverse the order of the array 
* hasNoDuplicates: checking if each value in the array is unique 
* unionWithNoDuplicates: combining two arrays and discarding duplicate values 
* shiftRight: shift the values in the array by an x number of indices to the right
* isInIncreasingOrder: checks if the array values are in increasing order from index 0 to its size n
