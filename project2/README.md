This project reviews C++ I/O and basic operations. The objective was to implement a fare calculator for a ride sharing service. It prompts the user for their name, the distance they will be going, and ride type (basic or luxury), while checking for valid input. Depending on the input, the program calculates the fare and outputs it to the user.
