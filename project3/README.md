# Airport Flights Format Checker 
This project reviews C++ strings. The objective was to check if a string was correctly formatted to represent a flight identification. According to the spec, a well-formed string was two characters (airline name), followed by 2 to 3 digits (flight number), followed by a + or â€“ (late or early arrival), and up to two digits to (the number of minutes the flight was late or early).  Lastly, I implemented a function that checked how many flights were on time, and error checking if the string passed was well-formed.
